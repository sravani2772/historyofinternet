<p style="color: cornflowerblue">
    There are two main kinds of wasted food: food loss and food waste. Food loss is the bigger category, and
incorporates any edible food that goes uneaten at any stage. In addition to food that’s uneaten in homes
and stores, this includes crops left in the field, food that spoils in transportation, and all other food
that doesn’t make it to a store. Some amount of food is lost at nearly every stage of food production.

    Food waste is a specific piece of food loss, which the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic
Research Service (ERS), defines as “food discarded by retailers due to color or appearance and plate waste
by consumers.”

    Food waste includes the half-eaten meal left on the plate at a restaurant, food scraps from preparing
a meal at home and the sour milk a family pours down the drain.
