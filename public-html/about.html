<p style="color: burlywood">America wastes roughly 40 percent of its food.1 Of the estimated 125 to 160 billion pounds of food that goes to
waste every year, much of it is perfectly edible and nutritious.
    </p>
<p style="color: blueviolet">
    Food is lost or wasted for a variety of reasons : bad weather, processing problems, overproduction and unstable
    markets cause food loss long before it arrives in a grocery store, while overbuying, poor planning and confusion
    over labels and safety contribute to food waste at stores and in homes.

     Food waste also has a staggering price tag, costing this country approximately $218 billion
per year.
